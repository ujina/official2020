&nbsp;
> You blog whether you know it or not—even without a blog or website. You might not think of it as blogging. Yet, it is. Tweeting a photo or sharing an update on Facebook. A funny quote or story you see in your daily life. A beautiful sunset. Clueing in friends and family back home to a fun experience when you travel.
> 
> 
> Blogging on your own website is much better than directly using services like Twitter and Facebook because you own your own content; it’s your online hub that you control. When people read your content, it will link back to you. Not some third-party site.
> 
> 
> To spread the word to your social network—in case they don’t happen to know about or follow your blog—simply use features like [WordPress.com’s Publicize and Sharing](http://en.support.wordpress.com/publicize/) to share out the content to popular services (see[Jetpack Publicize](http://jetpack.me/support/publicize/) if you host your own blog).

> To understand what I mean by publishing your content on your own blog—then push it from there to any social media service easily—I recommend watching this video: [WordPress as Your Publishing Hub](http://wordpress.tv/2012/10/15/andrew-spittle-wordpress-as-your-publishing-hub/) by Andrew Spittle (about 25 minutes long).
